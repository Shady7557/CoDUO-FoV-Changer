# WARNING: Concerning the RA (Rebel Alliance) server, please read if you play Call of Duty: United Offensive's multiplayer.

There are other *(secure!)* servers than RA to play on. They are not all compromised, and the game itself is ultimately alive and safe to play.
Sadly, most servers will have fewer players active than RA. Alternatives are sprouting up, and it is ultimately our goal to keep the game alive, well, and **safe.**
Please exercise caution and beware that not all servers have well-meaning administrators and that, worse than banning you, they may take things a step further (see below).

They will likely ban you permanently for joining their server without having been given explicit permission to play there.
Ban appeals will be ignored; the channels are purely facades. Recently, they disabled all invites to Discord and thus ***making an appeal is impossible***. It is also *potentially dangerous*, as with every server you join, your public IP address is visible to server administrators.
**They demonstrated that they will publicly mention your IP's geolocation as well as past names,** ***even real names.***
Users who join with a VPN active will be coerced into ultimately giving up some sort of identity at the threat of being banned. 
They're quick to do this because their ban list is extensive, and **they suspect people are ban evading simply for using a VPN.**

For a safe space in United Offensive, please consider joining our Discord. Players will be treated with utmost kindness, patience, and respect. 
They will not be quickly banned unless their behavior is extreme or they are cheating in-game. Ban appeals will be promptly reviewed:

[Empire / CODUO NA Competitive Discord](https://discord.gg/tAsTyVQDjz)

To RA's very own ***StarKiller*** (you asked *me* for the map repo, then let us be banned without any given reason & ignored appeals), 
*you know what to do and how to resolve this issue.*

# CoD Widescreen Suite (CoDUO-FoV-Changer)
A comprehensive suite of tools to make Call of Duty (2003) and Call of Duty: United Offensive (2004) comfortably playable even in multiplayer on modern systems.
Includes a Field of View (FoV) changer for Call of Duty and Call of Duty: United Offensive and built in options to launch the game with desktop resolutions or other custom resolutions.

Useful for playing in widescreen resolutions in a game that only natively supports 4:3 aspect ratios. This allows you to set your FoV manually, to prevent your screen from being overly zoomed in when playing in widescreen. It also works as an FoV changer even if you want to keep the 4:3 resolution.

This project uses another one of my public projects, a very simple lightweight console app by the name of "Mover". You can find it here: [Mover](https://github.com/Shady7557/Mover)
Mover is used purely for updates since this app cannot update itself (executable would be in use).


Official Download Link can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/Shady7557/CoDUO-FoV-Changer/releases/latest)

Lastly, if you enjoy Call of Duty: United Offensive's multiplayer, you may be interested in my map archive. This map archive contains hundreds of custom, user-made maps. Many of these are now very hard to find online and a centralized repository for these maps is increasingly necessary. Find it here:
